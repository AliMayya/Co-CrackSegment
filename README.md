A novel collaborative semantic segmentation of concrete cracks method called Co-CrackSegment is proposed. 
Firstly, five models, namely the U-net, SegNet, DeepCrack19, DeepLabV3-ResNet50, and DeepLabV3-ResNet101 are trained to serve as core models for the ensemble model Co-CrackSegment. 
To build the ensemble model Co-CrackSegment, a new iterative approach based on the best evaluation metrics, namely the Dice score, IoU, pixel accuracy, precision, and recall metrics is developed. 
Results show that the Co-CrackSegment exhibits a prominent performance compared with core models and weighted average ensemble by means of the considered best statistical metrics.
